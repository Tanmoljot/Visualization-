To build a stock audit tool, you would create a system that allows businesses to verify their inventory levels against their financial records. This tool would typically include features such as:

Inventory Tracking: Monitor stock levels in real-time, allowing users to see what items are available and what needs rest ocked.

Discrepancy Reporting: Identify and report discrepancies between recorded and actual stock, helping businesses correct errors and maintain accurate records.

Automated Alerts: Set up notifications for low stock levels or discrepancies, ensuring timely action can be taken to address issues.

Comprehensive Reporting: Generate detailed reports on inventory usage, slow-moving items, and overall stock performance to aid in decision-making.

User -Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive interface that allows users to easily navigate the tool and access necessary information quickly.

By implementing these features, a stock audit tool can significantly enhance inventory management, reduce losses, and ensure compliance with financial regulations.
